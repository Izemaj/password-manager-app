# Building a Password Manager App with Python and Tkinter
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3 installed on your machine</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of Python and Tkinter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin, install the required libraries by running the following command:</p>
<pre>
pip install pyperclip tkinter
</pre>
<h2>Designing the GUI</h2>
<p>We will start by designing the GUI for our password manager application. We will use the Tkinter library to create various widgets such as labels, buttons, and entry fields for the user to interact with the application.</p>
<pre>
# Set up the Tkinter GUI
window = Tk()
window.title("Password Manager")
window.config(width=500, height=500, padx=20,pady=20)
<h3>Create a canvas to display the logo image</h3>
canvas = Canvas(width=200, height=200)
logo = PhotoImage(file="logo.png")
canvas.create_image(100,100, image=logo)
canvas.grid(row=0, column=1)
